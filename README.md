# Cat vs. Dog Classification

## Project Overview
This project is a deep learning-based image classification model that distinguishes between images of cats and dogs. The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve accurate predictions on test images.

## Dataset
The dataset used consists of labeled images of cats and dogs. The data is typically sourced from publicly available datasets like Kaggle's Cats vs. Dogs dataset. The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

## Model Architecture
The model follows a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with the following layers:
1. Convolutional Layers (Extracting features from images)
2. Max-Pooling Layers (Reducing dimensionality)
3. Fully Connected Layers (Making predictions)
4. Output Layer (Binary classification: cat or dog)

## Training Process
1. Preprocessing: Images are resized and normalized.
2. Data Augmentation: Techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied.
3. Model Training: The CNN is trained using an optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy).
4. Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using accuracy and loss metrics.

## Results
- The model achieves a high accuracy in distinguishing cats from dogs.
- A confusion matrix is used to analyze misclassifications.

## STEPS
1. Install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python


   

2.Run the Jupyter Notebook Image Classification (Cats vs. Dogs).ipynb.

3.Upload an image of a cat or dog to see the model's prediction.


## Future Improvements

Fine-tuning with transfer learning (e.g., using ResNet50 or VGG16).

Increasing dataset size for better generalization.

Deploying the model as a web application.
